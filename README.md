Abstract
An unknown keyword, to technical descriptions of a machine, to places we want to visit or a subject we wish to learn, every search required the internet to fill in the gaps of knowledge we may having. Several search engines, applications and offline CD try and bridge this gap of information that individuals may be possessing. However those that offer complete information of wide variety of topics generally require a steady internet connection or massive storages on the other hand offline CD DVD and modules are limited by their list of topics and at times to don’t cover the scope of topics the user may require. 
Thus to come up with a cost effective , portable solution with a wide range of integrated topics in a user friendly and easy to understand as well as browse is the current need. Our Dhronacharya Open Source Education System on board a Raspberry Pie Model 3, nicknamed Dhron-Pi meets each of these demands, today.
 With more than 70% or schools through India having no form computer architecture let alone a consistent Internet connection, Dhron Pi would provide the means to deliver trusted set of information to students as well as teachers. 
Dhron-Pi serves as an access point; data hub and server to its clients thus single headily provide text, images and videos to the user through either a local host directly through the users browser or with the aid of an interactive Graphical User Interface on board the Dhron-Pi as well as associated PC nodes.
